 <h1 align="center"> Hi! <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EllipticalThornyHypacrosaurus-max-1mb.gif" width="40px">
 </h1>
<p> I'm a full stack developer making web apps to make everyday lives easier. I specialize in frontend development. I'm a keen learner and have an inquisitive personality, making me want to explore new avenues whenever possible. I fiddle with Solidity on the side. </p>

<p> I currently work at Acko as a frontend engineer. I've previously worked at FrontRow. I also hang out at Developer Dao and do freelancing on the side. </p>
